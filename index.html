            <h3><span style="color:blue">A Past Experience</span></h3>
            <div>
                <p>My earliest, true experience of programming outside of the classroom was through a high-school internship course with a San Diego wealth firm <em>HoyleCohen</em>!<br> Through an 8-month internship, I originally spent my time working on marketing projects before transitioning to a second supervisor to learn about <code>VBA: Visual Basic for Application</code> for Microsoft Excel. Through this experience, I was partnered with a classmate and learned how to program macros to sort valuable financial data. Although these tasks were short - and given that I wasn't very good at programming back then - I was still able to gain an early grasp of the level of maturity and communication required to succeed in a work environment.</p>
            </div>
            <hr>
                    
            <div>
                <p>Imagine if this next set of text was blocked together in a single, square grid. Additionally, imagine that this square was printed in a color other than white!</p>
                <p>This visual detail is describing the very HTML tag that this text is written inside of. Try and guess what is I'm referring to!</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>Alright, back to topic. And by topic, I mean more <span style="color:blue">experimentation</span> <span style="color:orange">with</span> <span style="color:purple">my</span> <span style="color:green">text</span>.</p>
            <p>In other words, I know understand the difference between span and div... I think.</p>
